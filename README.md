### Description:

Sekiro: Dream of the Damned is an overhaul mod for sekiro that is focused on New content in the final invasion state of the game.
It is highly recommended to begin the mod on a save just after, or right before beating the divine dragon boss, as most of the mods' content is a part of the second invasion of Ashina.
This mod adds reworks for
- Gyoubu Oniiwa
- Genichiro Ashina
- Isshin Ashina
- Sword Saint Ishhin
- Demon of Hatred

There are also reworks for every enemy in the final invasion, including: 
- Red Guard
- Generals
- Lone Shadows
- Fencers, and more with added minibosses being present to test you on these new changes!

There are new enemy placements and the layout of the area is edited to open up new paths of progression. 

In Ashina, Damned Spirits wander the land killing all they encounter, but for a Shinobi seeking strength, each provides a unique challenge to take on unlike any combatant taken on prior.

##### List of mini-bosses and where to find them:

- **Bounding Monkey** at **Snake Valley**
- **Nightjar** at **Ashina Castle**
- **Ronin** post the **Old Grave**
- **Shigekichi** at the same position as base game
- **Ashina Elite** before **Old Grave**
- **Stone Fist Monk** at First Idol of Senpou

##### Miscellaneous changed opponents locations:
 
- Lone Shadow: Snake Valley
- Red Guard: After Snake Valley
- General: Ashina Reservoir
- Damned Red Guard: Near Dungeon
- Damned Shinobi Hunter: End of Ashina Outskirts
- Damned Swordsman: Reservoir Well

<u><strong>Again, It is highly recommended to begin the mod on a save just after, or right before beating the divine dragon boss. as the meat of the mod is in the final invasion and other boss reworks can be fought simply by viewing the reflections</strong></u>

To best experience the mod, it is recommended to explore the map as though you haven't experienced the final invasion state before.
Also, Do not use save files from other mods, it can cause issues.
