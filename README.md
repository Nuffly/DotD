### Description:

Sekiro: Dream of the Damned is an overhaul mod for sekiro that is focused on New content in the final invasion state of the game.
It is highly recommended to begin the mod on a save just after, or right before beating the divine dragon boss, as most of the mods' content is a part of the second invasion of Ashina.
This mod adds reworks for
- Gyoubu Oniiwa
- Genichiro Ashina
- Isshin Ashina, and more! 

There are also reworks for every enemy in the final invasion, including: 
- Red Guard
- Generals
- Lone Shadows
- Fencers, and more with added minibosses being present to test you on these new changes!

There are new enemy placements and the layout of the area is edited to open up new paths of progression. 

In Ashina, Damned Spirits wander the land killing all they encounter, but for a Shinobi seeking strength, each provides a unique challenge to take on unlike any combatant taken on prior.
